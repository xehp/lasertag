Safety information Lithium-Ion batteries


LiIon batterys are classified as hazardous materials due to their ability of starting a fire.


1) Do not take LiIon batteries as checked in luggage in aircraft. Luggage handling on airports
   is often quite careless and a damaged battery is quite likely to cause a fire.

2) Do not charge LiIon batteries without supervision. At the very least a fire alarm
   is required.

3) If LiIon batteries shall be stored long term they must not be fully charged. 
   About 1/3 is recomended. 

4) Do not charge LiIon batteries at subzero temperatures.

LiIon batteries are not particulary bad for environment but shall be disposed of with 
some care anyway. Well even a dumpster fire can be a bad thing.
