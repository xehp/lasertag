History

2005-02-16 Modified for atmega8 and renamed. Used some code from an GPL avr platform written by Lukas Karrer. /Henrik Bj√∂rkman
2005-07-01 cleanup. /Henrik
2005-07-09 Renamed uart_packet to uart_buf. /Henrik
2005-07-09 Renamed uart_packet to uart_buf, moved it to its own file. Henrik
2012-05-12 Removed buffered mode. Keeping only stream mode. /Henrik
2012-05-21 Restored some extra features. Henrik
2016-08-02 renamed the functions for compatibility with another project. /Henrik
