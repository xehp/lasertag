This is a simple helloworld program for AVR ATMEGA168 micro controllers.



Put "habl" on the atmega168

# Install compiler and avrdude (on debian/ubuntu/mint style linux):
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc binutils-avr avrdude cutecom lrzsz screen


This may also be handy (but not required)
apt-get install picocom 


compile:
make

make sure to allow user to use dialout (or else you must run screen and cutecom as root) replace henrik below with your username.
sudo usermod -a -G dialout henrik


Connect to the device
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 19200
To leave Ctrl-A D
To and kill screen: Ctrl-A k y



Or picocom:
picocom --b 19200 /dev/ttyUSB0
To leave Ctrl-A Ctrl-X



When booting with HABL send 5 esc "1b 1b 1b 1b 1b" to habl within the first 3 seconds to enter X modem mode.
Habl will sen  a 'C' once per second to confirm it is ready for xmodem.


Send the file "havrapp.bin" with cutecom xmodem

If cutecom xmodem did not work perhaps this is why:
