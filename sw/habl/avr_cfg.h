// A note about code size:
// Using avr-gcc 4.3.2 the code is not as small as it was using 4.1.2
// The version string and the CRC check no longer both fit in 512 words.
// So there are three options here.
// 1) Use old compiler or find/set code size options.
// 2) Remove WELCOME_STRING (comment WELCOME_STRING out below)
// 3) Don't use CRC (comment use macro IGNORE_CSUM below)
// 4) Make boot sector larger (1024 words)
// If you wish to use a 1024 word bootloader section you also need to change
// fuse bits see avrdude_usb_atmega328p.txt and in the makefile.
// Current version will use 1024 word bootloader.

// Recommended baud rates are 300, 9600 or 19200,
// If FOSC is 16 MHz and 115200 is selected here we get 125000 baud instead.

// Define this if boot loader shall enable watchdog timer

// A major problem with XMODEM is to know if its 16bit CRC or 1 byte simple checksum.
// cutecom and hyperterminal seems to use 16bit CRC. Many others 1 byte simple checksum.
#define USE_XMODEM_CRC16

// The program might not fit in 512 word boot loader unless checksum is ignored.
// So if START_ADRESS_OF_BOOT_SECTION=0x7C00 this is macro needs to be defined
// so that HABL will fit in the smaller boot section.
